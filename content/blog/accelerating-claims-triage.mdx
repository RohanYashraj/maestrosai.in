## The Efficiency Frontier in Claims

The first 24 hours of a claim are critical. The speed and accuracy of initial triage determine everything from customer satisfaction to ultimate leakage control. Yet, most claims organizations are still burdened by manual document handling and consistent data entry.

### Intelligent Intake: The First Mile

The "First Mile" of a claim is often the most friction-filled. Documents arrive in disparate formats—PDFs, images, emails—and require human eyes to extract basic facts.

MaestrosAI’s automation layer solves this by:

- **Intelligent Extraction**: High-fidelity data capture from FNOL documents.
- **Contextual Summarization**: Synthesizing multi-page reports into actionable highlights.
- **Priority Routing**: Ensuring high-severity or complex claims reach the right specialist instantly.

### Measure What Matters

We focus on the KPIs that drive P&L impact:

- **Reduction in Triage Time**: Moving from hours to seconds.
- **Improved Routing Accuracy**: Reducing the "bounce rate" between claims adjusters.
- **Lower Leakage**: Identifying subrogation or fraud signals at the moment of intake.

Stay tuned as we dive deeper into our claims modernization frameworks in the coming weeks.
